I was born in Rome. I spent my childhood and adolescence putting the clock back to the bang of the Gianicolo cannon and consuming the soles of shoes on the cobblestones of Trastevere.
Likewise of part of my generation, I was bribed at an early age by those mysterious boxes that were "home computers" , that brought magic into our bedrooms, turning them into joystick's  cemeteries and tape cassettes warehouses .... the data storage media of those days.

I have been fascinated by the sagas of Star Wars and Star Trek, which convinced me that there is always a five-year mission (but there are also three-year plans!) to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations (architectures and technologies), to boldly go where no man ( and Italian) has gone before.

The curiosity to understand how the computers worked led me to attend the faculty of Computer Engineering, then making of the computer science my profession and at the end making me even more curious. My first work experiences drove me into the world of the first Roman internet providers, realities made of passion and a lot of good will. There I started to become familiar with the open source world and to discover its potential.

At a later stage I started a job for Telecom where I started a number of different services, by now outdated by the current smartphone reality (to name one ... who remembers the Wap?).

Over the years I have worked in some Italian startups, GiocoDigitale was the last, the most engaging, which allowed me to follow the company's growth, its consolidation on the market, up to its acquisition in a worldwide structure (Bwin). An experience that allowed me to cover different roles and to learn to interface with some aspects of regulated markets in Italy.

The rumors of the TeamDigitale and its mission came to me in several ways : blogs, podcasts and newspapers ... .. how could I resist? When I heard that the TeamDigitale's Enterprise was looking for new crew, I couldn't  esitate and suddenly I'm here, pushing to warp speed the country where my daughter was born and is growing.

I can start this journey thanks to the patience and support of my wife but also thanks to the availability of the company where I work, Bwin Italia, which shares my enthusiasm for this project and also granted me a period of leave , allowing me to join to this exciting adventure in the best way.
